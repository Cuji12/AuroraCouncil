## Description

Loot overview and distribution addon for 1.12 World of Warcraft.

This Addon is in an early stage, there might be breaking bugs. If you encounter any breaking bugs, the addon can be resetted by the loot master entering "/console reloadui" into the ingame chat.

## Installation

1. Close World of Warcraft
2. Extract the "AuroraCouncil" directory into "your\path\to\World of Warcraft\Interface\AddOns\"
3. Activate AuroraCouncil in the character selection screen under "Addons"

## Usage

The Addon will activate itself when you're in a Group/Raid with masterloot activated.

General Flow:
1. Loot master is looting a corpse
2. If there is loot that can be distributed via master loot, the loot distribution will start
3. Loot master clicks on an item to distribute, a window with loot options (need/greed/...) will appear for everyone
4. After selecting a loot option by clicking on it, you will see a list of players an their decisions
5. The loot master can now select a player in that list of players and assign it by clicking on the player entry in that list
6. Steps 2 - 5 repeat until there is no assignable loot left
